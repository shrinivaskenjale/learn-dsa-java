// A greedy algorithm is an approach for solving a problem by selecting the best
// option available at the moment. It doesn't worry whether the current best
// result will bring the overall optimal result.

// The algorithm never reverses the earlier decision even if the choice is
// wrong. It works in a top-down approach.

// Common things in greedy problems is finding min/max, sorting, activity
// selection problem.
