/*

Patterns use nested loops.
Outer loop is for rows.
Inner loop is for columns.

===========================
Steps to solve patterns:
===========================

1. For outer loop, count no. of rows.

2. For inner loop, focus on the columns and connect them somehow to the rows.

3. Print the pattern inside inner loop.

4. Print a newline inside the outer loop after the inner loop to move to next row.

5. Observe whether there is any symmetry in the pattern:
- If the pattern is symmetrical horizontally, print the left part and then right part.
- If the pattern is symmetrical vertically, first print part above then the part below.
