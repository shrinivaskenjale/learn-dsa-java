/*

Bubble Sort is named so because larger elements "bubble up" to the end of the array
with each pass through adjacent swaps.

It's a stable sorting algorithm.

It is an in-place sorting algorithm.

Bubble sort makes n-1 passes in the worst case for an array of size n.

If no swap is performed during a pass, the array is already sorted â€” this can be used as
an optimization.

Space complexity: O(1)

Time complexity: O(n^2)
Best case: O(n) ...sorted (at least 1 round needs to be performed)
Worst case: O(n^2) ...reverse sorted

Applications:
1. We place kth largest element at right position.
