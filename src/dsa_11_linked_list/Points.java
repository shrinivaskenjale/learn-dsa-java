// A linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a
// reference(link) to the next node in the list.

// A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not
// stored at contiguous memory locations.

/*
 * Array vs LL
 * 1. Insertion deletion is easy as there is no shifting required like arrays.
 * 2. LL is dynamic DS, it can grow/shrink at run-time.
 */

// If expected complexity is constant, then problem must be solved by changing
// links.
