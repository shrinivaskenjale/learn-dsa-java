// BST is a binary tree in which every parent node is greater than left child
// and smaller than right child. Which means, all nodes in left subtree are
// smaller than root node and all nodes in right subtree are greater than root
// node.

// Inorder traversal of bst is sorted.
// Leftmost node in bst is minimum.
// Rightmost node in bst is maximum.

// Inorder Predecessor: It is right most child of left subtree of given node.
// Inorder Successor: It is left most child of right subtree of given node.

// Preorder traversal is same as order of insertion.
